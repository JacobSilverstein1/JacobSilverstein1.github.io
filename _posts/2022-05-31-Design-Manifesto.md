### Design Manifesto

#### Introduction: Our Project

A Curious Process: Designing is an interesting phenomenon. An average person can start with nothing, not even an idea, and can end up with a final product that can do something good for the world. At the beginning of the school year, when we were brainstorming ideas for ways to promote community engagement, I started to think about ways that we could improve the Horace Mann experience for students. In my individual project pitch, I talked about helping students to access printers in a way that would promote community and bring people together. But as I began to work with my partners, and we thought a little bit more about problems within our community, it became clear to us that we wanted to focus on something that related more directly to students at Horace Mann: helping new students find friends and have a better social life. Through our design process, we began to reform this idea, engaging in a cycle of feedback and change until we came up with a final product and idea that we truly felt passionate about and felt would foster tangible change within the HM community. In this manifesto, I will take you through the guiding principles we used that influenced our process and allowed us to have success. 

#### Collaboration

Shared Vision: From the beginning, we recognized that our ideas for what we wanted our design to center on were quite different. But in our group project proposal, we set forth some principles that would shape the direction we wanted to go with our project:

1. Project Goal: Aiming to substantively and positively improve the Horace Mann community and benefit the lives of our target users. 
2. Collaboration: Creating a respectful and considerate team environment while working dedicatedly and collaboratively towards the end goal. Agreeing to basic principles of courtesy: actively listening to others, working to be accommodating to others, following through on the goals we set for ourselves and others, and trying to lift others in the group up instead of putting each other down. 

Distribution of Work: We aimed to have fluid group roles, with everyone working as collaboratively as possible towards the end goal. We recognized that some people are inherently better at certain aspects of the design, writing, and app-building process, and aimed to work in a way that highlighted each of our strengths while still allowing for dynamic collaboration. 

#### Personal Code of Ethics

Honesty and Integrity: The initial idea we had for our project was to help incoming freshmen to make new friends at Horace Mann. But through our Contextual Inquiries, which meant talking to stakeholders and potential users at Horace Mann, we realized that our original idea probably would not have the impact we intended it to. We realized that there weren't that many users that would really want our app, so we shifted our app idea to accomplish tasks that more people would find helpful. We recognized how important it was to be honest with ourselves about our idea, and though we had an initial vision, we needed to consider others' input to reform our project idea throughout the design process. 

Accountability: Because the goal that we wanted to accomplish with our app was lofty, to foster community engagement, it required dedicated effort from everyone involved with the design process. In our group, we needed to not just hold each other accountable not just for getting work done, but for staying true to the design ideas we set out for ourselves at the beginning of the process. By staying dedicated to our original guiding principles, we were able to come up with an idea and design for an app that could genuinely improve the high school experience for Horace Mann students. 

Respect: In the design process, I found that respect can come in many forms. To start, we did user-based research on many occasions. The people we worked with volunteered to help us, so it was necessary to show them respect, both during the testing and afterwards. Keeping our volunteers anonymous in our write-ups respected their confidentiality and made sure that our testing process was not obscured by people having to worry about their names showing up in our project. But respect also came in other forms, including within our group and with users. In our initial team contract, we set out mutual respect as a key principle to collaboration. This allowed us to work together towards a final goal despite our differences, creating a team environment in which everyone acknowledged each others' abilities. 

#### Accessibility in Design

Empathy and Fairness: Throughout the design process, we worked to make our product as accessible as possible to as many users as possible. The way we were able to push for accessibility in that way is through empathy. We remained empathetic to what users wanted from our app, which is what motivated us to change the idea for our app design towards the middle of the design process. Furthermore, through Usability Testing and Heuristic Evaluations, we made sure to incorporate data we collected from users, trying to make our app more accessible to more people. 

#### User-Centered Design

User-Centered Design: Though we were aiming to be creative with our design, we realized the importance of centering our process around users. Only by relying on their input, and continually gathering data directly from users, would we be able to create a final product that users would be interested in. 

Feedback: A key cornerstone of the design process is getting feedback directly from users. We made sure to communicate with users in the most direct way, asking them to tell us exactly what they were thinking about our design and ways that we could improve it. In the Contextual Inquiries, when we were conducting interviews, giving our inquiry subjects anonymity allowed them to communicate more openly about their experiences, giving us the best possible information to incorporate into our design.

#### Trust the Process

Faith: By taking this App Development class, we put our faith in this style of user-based iterative design. We trusted that we could create a comprehensive, useful, and interesting final project through this process of prototyping, getting feedback, analyzing how to change our design, and bringing that together by designing and coding final prototypes and a final digital mockup. I, along with my group, put my faith completely in these techniques, and that allowed me to see both individual and collective success. 

#### Conclusion: Learning and Repeating

To me, the most valuable part of the design process was having the ability to watch our group's progress throughout the whole year. We each grew as designers, coders, and creative thinkers, but more importantly, grew as people as we worked with each other and with users and stakeholders to work towards this final project. While FRNDS started as an idea to improve the school, it now represents a year worth of hard work, collaboration, effort, and time. When, at the beginning of the school year, we were presented with the goal of promoting community engagement, I thought that we would be doing that through our final project. But what I did not expect was that the design process, and the important principles that guided me through it, would bring our group together in the way that it did.
