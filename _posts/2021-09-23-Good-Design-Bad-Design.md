## Good vs Bad Design

### Good Design

I think Netflix's Picture in Picture feature for iPhone is an example of really good design. 
First of all, not all video apps have Picture in Picture (for example, YouTube), an extremely useful feature that 
allows one to, for example, respond to a text while still watching their show or video. Netflix's PiP not 
only lets you pause and play while watching in a small part of your screen, but also lets you wind forward or back 10 seconds. 
This allows for a watching experience that is normal despite the small surface area of the screen devoted to it. Finally, 
the feature allows for one to easily swipe the PiP over to the side of the screen, allowing you access to the full screen to do something 
before swiping the PiP back onto your screen.

### Bad Design

To me, a bad design is the imperial unit system. While the metric system has units of measure that are coordinated 
with a base-10 system, allowing one to easily translate between units using scientific notation, the imperial system 
requires some wacky conversions, like 5280 feet to a mile. Furthermore, the metric system has units that are both extremely 
large and extremely small for measurement, and it is easy to describe the relationship between two units in terms of just 
multiplying or dividing by 10^x. This lack of intuitiveness and impracticality of conversions of the imperial system explains 
why nearly all countries and every scientist uses the metric system for measurements.
